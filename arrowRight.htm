		ease  : the easing function to use, which can be "linearTween" (default) or one of the following strings:
				"easeInQuad"		t^2         acceleration from zero velocity
                "easeOutQuad"		t^2         deceleration  to  zero velocity
                "easeInOutQuad"		t^2         acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
                "easeInCubic"		t^3         acceleration from zero velocity
                "easeOutCubic"		t^3         deceleration  to  zero velocity
                "easeInOutCubic"	t^3         acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
                "easeInQuartic"		t^4         acceleration from zero velocity
                "easeOutQuartic"	t^4         deceleration  to  zero velocity
                "easeInOutQuartic"	t^4         acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
                "easeInQuintic"		t^5         acceleration from zero velocity
                "easeOutQuintic"	t^5         deceleration  to  zero velocity
                "easeInOutQuintic"	t^5         acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
				"easeInSine"		sinusoidal  acceleration from zero velocity
				"easeOutSine"		sinusoidal  deceleration  to  zero velocity
                "easeInOutSine"		sinusoidal  acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
				"easeInExpo"		exponential acceleration from zero velocity
                "easeOutExpo"		exponential deceleration  to  zero velocity
                "easeInOutExpo"		exponential acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
                "easeInCirc"		circular    acceleration from zero velocity
                "easeOutCirc"		circular    deceleration  to  zero velocity
                "easeInOutCirc"		circular    acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
                "easeInBounce"		elastic     bounce, then acceleration from zero velocity
                "easeOutBounce"		elastic     deceleration  to  zero velocity, then bounce
                "easeInOutBounce"	elastic     bounce, then acceleration until halfway, then deceleration, then bounce
				Please be aware that these strings are CASE-SENSITIVE e.g. "easeInBounce", NOT "easeinbounce".
